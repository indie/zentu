            <h4>I.  Lot Plan Considerations</h4>

            <p>The best way to begin is to have a look the site with an <em>ecosteader's</em> set of eyes. This means <u>first</u> envisioning how the existing nature-made landscape can be integrated into the whole of the habitat.</p>

            <p>  Rather than bulldozing the terrain to make way for the nuances of a drawing by some architect who has never seen the property, it's a far better to approach to go in from the very beginning with an ecologically-inclined perspective. This means planning the outdoor living space as it will be used <em>first</em>, and working backwards, maintaining flexibility with details toward the indoor living plans. </p>

            <p>A great place to begin is with a well-detailed <strong>Lot Plan</strong> that makes note of the following features:</p>

            <h5>A. Plantings</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Native plants</b> -- identify and decide whether/how to preserve; usually it's a good idea to keep some native plants for soil and erosion concerns.  Native plants also require less watering because they are naturally "in tune" with the local climate </li>
                <li>Additional plants / landscaping -- aesthetic appeal is only part of the picture</li>
                <li>Make note and remember that existing and future plantings will set the stage for the immediate outdoor climate, which has a direct effect on the indoor climate -- which direction gets the most morning sun?  The most afternoon sun?
                <li>Watering and drainage direction for existing and future plantings</li>
              </ul>
          
          <h5>B. Geology</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Slopes, drainage, erosion concerns</li>
              <li>Elevation changes</li>
              <li>Soil type</li>
            </ul>
          <h5>C. Orientation</h5>
              <div class="sublist">
              1.  Solar orientation <br />
                <ul>
                  <li>Maximize winter sun -- do mature planting change this?</li>
                  <li>Minimize summer heat -- do mature plantings change this?</li>
                  <li>Solar panels + access</li>
                  <li>Green roofing</li>
                </ul>
              2.  Wind <br />
              3.  Views and future developments<br />
              4.  Feng Shui, if that's your cup o'tea <br />

              </div>    
          
          <h5>D.  Utilities</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Grid power (box + access to box) &amp; power storage</li>  
              <li>Water hookups from the street or city?  From a well?  Haul in water for a tank?</li>
              <li>Sewer, septic or cess pool</li>
              <li>Natural gas</li>
              <li>Geothermal resources, if any</li>
            </ul>

          <h5>E.  Outdoor Living and Storage Areas</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Trash and recycling storage -- what's the proximiity to kitchen?  Do you have to go out through snow to take out the trash?</li>
              <li>Compost pile/bin -- proximity to garden?</li>
              <li>Garden</li>
              <li>Outdoor entertaining space -- deck / patio / firepit / etc.</li>
              <li>Storage for outdoor / garden tools</li>
              <li>Electrical outlets</li>
              <li>Areas vulnerable to wildlife (deer, birds, squirrels, etc) -- are they welcome, or unwanted?</li> 
              <li>Lighting for outdoor living areas</li>
              <li>Automobile storage</li>
              <li>Automotible charging station (electric vehicles)</li>
              <li>Recreational equipment storage</li>
              <li>Fencing or borders for privacy + paths </li>
              <li>US Postal Mail service
            </ul>

          <h5>F.  Indoor Living / Dwelling </h5>
          <p>At this stage, it's best to just have a general size and shape with the main utility access points noted; details of the indoor space -- except for, perhaps, windows, should not be outlined on the lot plan 
            <div class="sublist">
            1.  Square footage <br />
            2.  Style of dwelling <br />
            3.  Access + flow <br />
            4.  Common mistakes in design
                <ul>  
                  <li>no easy access from automobile parking -> kitchen</li>
                  <li>no easy access from back yard or play area -> bathroom (for children or guests)</li>
                  <li>laundry area located where noise disrupts living space</li>
                  <li>windows above tub/shower -- the nooks + crannies of window design can accelerate the production of mold + rot  </li>
                  </ul>
            </div> 
            
       </div><!-- end span4 -->
      
      <div class="span5">
        <h4>II.  Foundation Plan</h4>
            <p>A <strong>Foundation Plan</strong> shows how the structure will be attached to the earth; specifically how the footers, foundation, and sill all fit together.  In general, the foundation will sit upon a footer which has been carefully engineered for a specific site.  The footer is a vital and essential aspect of construction that helps distribute the weight of the structure over a large enough area of ground such that pockets of settling don't occur. </p>
            <h5>A. Footings</h5>
              <p>Building <em>footings</em>, sometimes called <strong>footers</strong>, help a structure establish proper posture. These are, quite literally, the pressure points of lode-bearing weight.  Just as yoga teachers stress proper footing for posture and alignment of the spine (and thus the skeleton), so too can properly-engineered footers strengthen and lengthen the durability of a building, helping it stand up better to the elements and time.</p>
              <div class="sublist">
                1.  Things that can disturb footings:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Geological events</li>
                      <ul><li>earthquakes</li>
                          <li>erosion or landslides</li></ul>
                    <li>Geological conditions</li>
                      <ul><li> sinkholes</li>
                          <li> lack of bedrock</li>
                          <li> high water tables</li>
                          <li> proximity to a body of water</li>
                          <li> proximity to a flood plain</li></ul>
                    <li>Atmospheric events</li> 
                      <ul><li>tornadoes</li>
                          <li> hurricanes</li>
                          <li> high-wind or annual blizzard conditions</li></ul>
                    <li>Atmospheric conditions</li>
                      <ul><li>drastic changes in climate between winter and summer, causing the earth itself to expand and contract abnormally</li>
                          <li>high-humidity environments</li></ul>
                    <li>Soil conditions</li> 
                        <ul><li>the presence of organic material in the soil which will eventually rot.  For example: building on a site that has an extensive root system underneath is not ideal.  The roots will eventually die and rot, which may create a "cave-in" situation underneath the ground.  Extra care should be taken to place footings where the earth is solid.</li>
                          <li>soil that is extremely weak or loamy</li>
                          <li>recently moved earth -- this soil has not had time to settle and compact, and placing weight upon loose soil will eventually cause it to </li> </ul>
                    <li>Other</li>
                        <ul>proximity to railroads or freeways which emit vibrations in the earth, wearing down footers and foundations more quickly<li>      
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="sublist">
                2.  Simultaneous considerations while the footer / foundation is being installed should be taken into account.  Depending on the type of foundation, these can be very labor-intensive and costly to repair or re-route, once the foundation is set:
                  <ul>
                    <li> drains </li>
                    <li> sewer/septic </li>
                    <li> water </li>
                    <li> gas lines </li>
                    <li> electric </li>
                    <li> phone and data networking cables </li>
                    <li> radiant heating systems </li>
